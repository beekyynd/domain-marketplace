    <p>Domainer is a platform that has no ownership over any domain listed. Hence, a buyer may only receive a refund if the seller fails to meet up to their end of agreement. After 14 days of purchase and the seller has not initiated the domain transfer process, the buyer will receive a refund which may be subject to processing fees.
